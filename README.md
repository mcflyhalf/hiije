# HIIJE

*Hiije* is a recommendation system currently built for grocery recommendations. The system itself is an implementation of [the work of Karypis and Deshpande](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/papers/itemrsTOIS04.pdf). The description there is very technical and is recommended for people who actually intend to implement, extend or adapt the algorithm in some way.
